<h1>About Good Hire</h1>

<h2>Welcome to the Good Hire Game!</h2>

<h3>What are the important personal characteristics or skills for a good hiring?</h3>

<h3>Find out by trying to guess the words in the game.</h3>
    <p>
    For every attempt guessed, your path to success increases as for every wrong attempt, your path to a failure will get closer and closer.
    Earn a point for each correct word and keep playing and increasing your score.
    Play wisely, because after you miss seven times your game will be over.
    <p/>
<p>
    Enjoy the Multiplayer mode with your family and friends!
    The player creates any word with maximum 10 letters and then the challenge has begun.
    The second player has to guess the word now. Guessing the words you keep playing and making points and when you get a game over is time to chance the challenger.
